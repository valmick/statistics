    "### Why do we need Hypothesis testing\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is a general belief of the population about some parameter\n",
    "  e.g. Average height\n",
    "- Then we take a sample from it and measure that some parameter, we suspect that the parameter is varying from population parameter\n",
    "  e.g. We believe that the average height in your school or office or neighborhood is higher or lower than that of the population\n",
    "- So we do a hypothesis testing\n",
    "- We frame a Null Hypothesis usually denoted as $H_0$, the null hypothesis is the belief of the 'parameter value' of the population\n",
    "- And then the Alternate Hypothesis usually denoted as $H_a$, the alternate hypothesis is based on your local sample observation\n",
    "- So the next step is basically is to see the observation in our local sample is because of 'random sampling of the population', or the observation is such an outlier that it cannot explain by the 'random sampling of the population'. In the later case we go ahead reject the $H_0$ and say we believe in $H_a$\n",
    "- Now how do we say that the P(parameter values due to random sampling| Give $H_0$) is not an outlier.\n",
    "- By coming up with an idea of \"Signicance level\" $\\alpha$\n",
    "- How do we interpret $\\alpha$?\n",
    "> If -> P(parameter values due to random sampling| Give $H_0$) < $\\alpha$ \n",
    "\n",
    "It means that the probability of the occurrence of the value is very low, and cannot be explained by random sampling of the population. Hence we reject the $H_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If -> P(parameter values due to random sampling| Give $H_0$) >= $\\alpha$ \n",
    "\n",
    "It means the probability of the occurrence of the value can be examplained by random sampling of populaion and hence we cannot reject the $H_0$\n",
    "\n",
    "- So the question now is how do we evaluate P(parameter values due to random sampling| Give $H_0$, i.e. the population parameter value)\n",
    "- One of the ways is if you know the $\\overline x$, average of the sample, $s$, standard deviation of the sample then we can use equation of Normal distribution to simulate the sample, and then randomly sample from it multiple times and put together a probability of a value - best done with an example below.\n",

    "To see how likely a sample like this was to happen by random chance alone, Evie performed a simulation. She simulated 40 samples of n=25, equals, 25 students from a large population where 6%, percent of the students were vegetarian. She recorded the proportion of vegetarians in each sample.
